description: Show and edit the Claudergency config file
---

Read the file at ~/.claude/claudergency.txt and display its contents to the user. Each line is a separate option that gets randomly selected and appended to prompts.

Ask the user what changes they'd like to make. If the file doesn't exist, let the user know and offer to create one with a default message.
